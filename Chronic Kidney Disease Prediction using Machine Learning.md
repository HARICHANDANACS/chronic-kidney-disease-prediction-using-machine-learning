This project aims to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning algorithms. It uses various patient health attributes, such as age, blood pressure, and serum creatinine levels, to classify whether a patient is likely to have CKD or not. The project uses a dataset to train a machine learning model for classification purposes.
